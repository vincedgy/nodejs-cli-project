# NodeJS CLI boostrap project

This project is a simple CLI using a lot of great tools.

It uses ESM for packaging.

It's inspired from this article [https://www.twilio.com/blog/how-to-build-a-cli-with-node-js](https://www.twilio.com/blog/how-to-build-a-cli-with-node-js), but not limited to.

## Dependencises

- esm : nodejs module management
- arg : for commmand line arguments processing
- chalk : for ANSI colorization of the command line
- inquirer : modules that promps the user
- marked : Markedown compilation lib
- marked-terminal : displays Markedown (marked) to the terminal

- `src/main.js` : where resides your logic. It receives the JSON object with validated options
- `src/help.js` : helper function tha handle the display of HELP.md

- `bin/cli-project` : the project use ESM, this is the main project/module declaration file
